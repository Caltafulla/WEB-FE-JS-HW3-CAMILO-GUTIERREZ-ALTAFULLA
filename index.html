                <h1>Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript</h1>
                <p>
                    Asynchronous programming is essential in JavaScript due to its non-blocking nature. Although
                    JavaScript is a single-threaded language and is not asynchronous by itself, it manages to handle
                    multiple tasks simultaneously thanks to the event loop and environment APIs (such as browsers or
                    Node.js). These allow long operations, such as network requests, to run in the background while the
                    code continues its normal execution, preventing the main thread from being blocked. After
                    understanding how JavaScript manages to handle asynchrony, it is important to delve into the
                    different techniques and tools that allow us to work with asynchronous tasks efficiently.</p>

                    <h1>1. JavaScript Async</h1>
                    <p>
                        Asynchronous JavaScript allows code to run without waiting for certain operations, such as HTTP
                        requests or timers, to complete. Unlike other languages ​​where long operations block execution,
                        JavaScript uses a non-blocking asynchronous approach, managing tasks so that the flow of the
                        program is not interrupted. This is possible thanks to the event loop, which controls when to
                        execute certain tasks in the background and when to resume other tasks that require more time.

                        Basic Example:
                        <pre><code>
    console.log("Start");

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Asynchronous task complete!");
    }, 2000); // 2 seconds delay
                            
        console.log("End");
                        </code></pre>
                        Output:
                        <pre><code>
    Start
    End
    Asynchronous task complete!
                    </code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <div class="textbox">
                        <p>First, console.log("Start") is executed immediately.
                            Then setTimeout introduces an asynchronous task with a delay of 2 seconds. This task does
                            not
                            block the main thread, so the following console.log("End") is executed immediately.</p>
                        <p>After 2 seconds, the setTimeout task completes and its callback is executed, printing
                            "Asynchronous task completed!".</p>
                        <p>
                            This behavior reflects how JavaScript allows code to continue running without waiting for
                            asynchronous tasks to complete. Asynchrony in JavaScript is essential when working with
                            network
                            operations, timers, or any task that cannot be completed instantly.</p>

                    <h1>2. CallBack</h1>
                    <p>
                        A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when
                        the main task finishes. This pattern was one of the first ways to handle asynchronous operations
                        in JavaScript. Although effective, callbacks can become unwieldy when multiple asynchronous
                        operations are nested, known as "callback hell."

                                The fetchData function simulates data fetching with a 2-second setTimeout.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After the delay, it logs "Data fetched" and then calls the callback() (in this case,
                                processData).

                            <li>
                                Once the data is "fetched," processData is executed, printing "Processing data."

                            While useful for simple tasks, callbacks can make the code harder to read and maintain when

                            have multiple asynchronous operations.</p>

                        A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous
                        operation. Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle multiple asynchronous
                        tasks, avoiding the nested structure of callbacks. Promises have three states:

                    <p>
                        Async and await are more modern syntax to work with promises, making asynchronous code look more
                        like synchronous code. async turns a function into a promise, and await pauses the execution of
                        the function until the promise is resolved or rejected. This allows you to write asynchronous
                        code that’s easier to read and understand.

                    <p>
                        The event loop is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks and be
                        non-blocking. The key to understanding the event loop is knowing that JavaScript has a call
                        stack (where functions are placed to be executed) and a task queue (where asynchronous tasks,
                        like callbacks, are placed to be executed after the stack is clear).</p>
                    <p>
                        When an asynchronous operation is performed, it is placed in the task queue. The event loop
                        continuously monitors the call stack, and once it’s empty, it picks tasks from the queue and
                        executes them.

                    <div class="textbox">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                First, console.log("Start") runs immediately.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then, setTimeout with a 0ms delay is placed in the task queue but doesn’t execute
                                immediately because the call stack is still active.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                console.log("End") executes before the setTimeout task because it’s on the call stack.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finally, the event loop picks up the setTimeout callback and executes it, printing
                                "Asynchronous task."
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Even with a 0ms delay, the setTimeout callback is executed after the synchronous code
                            because the event loop ensures that the stack is clear before executing tasks from the
                            queue.</p>
